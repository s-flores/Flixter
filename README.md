   - [X] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [X] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Line 58 under MainActivity.java
When debuging with emulator under variables I had
Connected to the target VM, address:'localhost:8600', transport:'socket' 
and under console in MainActivity I get
Hit json exception
org.json JSONException: No value for results
Fixed by changing .getJsonmArray from "Results" to "results"

Line 58 under MainActivity.java
When debuging with real device after second thttps://portal-prd.humboldt.edu/psp/PAHUMPRD/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=DEFAULTry at debuging under variables I had
this = {MainActivity$1@10261}https://portal-prd.humboldt.edu/psp/PAHUMPRD/EMPLOYEE/EMPL/h/?tab=DEFAULTr
call = {RealCall@10312}
e = {UnknownHOstExcep:Unable@1013} "java.net.UnknownHOstException:Unable to resolve host "api.themoviedb.org": No address associated with hostname"
INTERNAL_ERROR = 500
Fixed by changing .getJsonmArray from "Results" to "results"

When using the Glide library I had 
"error: no suitable method found for into(TextView)method RequestBuilder"
for this line:
Glide.with(context).load(movie.getPosterPath()).into(ivPoster);
"ivPoster" is underlined in red.
Fixed problem by changing ivPoster datatype from textView to imageView
